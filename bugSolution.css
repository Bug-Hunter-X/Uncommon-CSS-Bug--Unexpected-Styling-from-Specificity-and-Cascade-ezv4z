Several strategies can improve CSS maintainability and predictability, avoiding specificity and cascade-related bugs.  Here are some solutions, demonstrated in `bugSolution.css`:

1. **Increase Specificity When Necessary:** If you need a specific style to override others, use more precise selectors (e.g., adding a more specific class or ID). This helps to avoid relying heavily on the cascade.

2. **Style Order Matters:**  The order of your stylesheets and rules within a stylesheet matters! Ensure important styles are placed later in the cascade.

3. **Avoid `!important` (When Possible):** While `!important` can be useful, overuse makes debugging incredibly difficult. Strive to resolve conflicts through better specificity and ordering.

4. **Use a CSS Preprocessor:** CSS preprocessors (like Sass or Less) can help organize CSS and avoid specificity conflicts through nesting and variables.

5. **CSS Methodology:** Consider using a CSS methodology (like BEM, OOCSS, or SMACSS) for better organization and maintainability. This helps predict how styles will apply.

```css
/* bugSolution.css - improved specificity and structure */
#container {
  color: blue;
}

.element {
  color: red; /* More specific selector to ensure that if #container .element is not present, this will apply */
}

#container .element {
  color: green;
}
/* Additional rules showing better specificity and structure */
.container-element {
  color: purple; /* More specific selector for this case */
}
```
