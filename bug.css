The CSS specificity rules can sometimes lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with complex selectors or inheritance.  For example, consider the following scenario:

```css
#container {
  color: blue;
}

.element {
  color: red;
}

#container .element {
  color: green;
}
```

If an element with the ID `container` contains an element with the class `element`, the text color will be green. However, understanding precisely which style rule takes precedence might not always be intuitive, leading to unexpected visual results.  Another common issue arises with the cascade itself; ensuring the correct order of stylesheets and the use of `!important` can create hard-to-debug issues if not carefully handled.
